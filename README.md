In this code I **do not** try to make it work in IE. If so, I would have to use older JS and not ES6.

I tested the code for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera (latest versions for each). Couldn't try on Safari since I don't have a Mac.

## CODING PROCESS

The steps I made was first do the mockup on plain HTML + CSS. Then converted to CSS3 variables. After that, I started with the JavaScript. While working with JavaScript, I also started to transform the CSS for mobile, doing 'mobile-first', so the media queries were not made with `max-with`, but with `min-width`.

One important thing to know is that the selector for 'Popular/Newest' doesn't do anything, neither the icon with an eye. They have been developed with the same characteristics as the other selector or icons, but they do nothing since:

1. It was not specified what the icon should do.
2. The voices do not have creation dates or fav counts to order them with the selector.

If they would have creation dates or fav counts, the ordering could be applied depending on this selector, so if you are selecting "Newest" and ascending, newers would come first. If it's descending, then the newers would come last.

## CSS

I tried to do the application as much pixel-pefect as I could in the given amount of time.

### W3C Validation

I tested the CSS code on https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/, and ignoring the Bootstrap file, the problems come from `-webkit-mask`, which is not a standar feature (but implemented on all browsers I tested), and from `linear-gradient`, which I do not really understand since my code is `linear-gradient(45deg, color1, color2)` and the W3C validation is `linear-gradient([ [ [ <angle> | to [top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? <color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+);`. I found this [on the MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient()), I was not able to find the official W3C definition on the W3C website.

Also tested the HTML on https://validator.w3.org/, and no errors were found! ðŸŽ‰

### ANIMATIONS

I added some **small animations**, not only to make it clearer, but also to make sure the user understands he did something, since he have time to see the effect on the icon.

As you can see on the image, I also made **the icons change color when being used or hovered/clicked**, and appear with the pointer cursor. This is to make sure the user understands, in this case, that the sorting is currently being applied. the hover is for the user to know that the button will do something.

I also show an other small animation for the caret on the selectors, also aviable on the collapsable containers, explained later.

### SVG ICONS 

An other important thing, is that, at first, I was changing the icons (SVG images) within the SVG itself, not with CSS, since it was within an `<img />` tag. The problem with this is that, when I had to change the color, I had no way of doing so. Certainly I can use `fill` or `stroke` on CSS, but these only would apply if I put the SVG as an string, not a URL on the `img`, so I had to think about a workaround.

The best option was to use `mask`. That meant changing the HTML structure, which meant changing the JS code with the jQuery selectors, plus changing all the CSS related to it. Thankfully it didn't take much effort. Now I was able to change the SVG color by changing the mask container background color! ðŸŽ‰

### FAV BUTTON

The fav button was supposed to appear on hover, and that is how it works for non-touchable screens. However, if the screen is touchable, while is true that you can simulate the 'hover' effect by a long press over the element on a touchable screen, I found that to be counter intuitive. Not only that, but it also selected the voice, which in a real case would not be the desired effect. Also, the user might not have an easy time to find out that they can add to favourites by long pressing the voice, that means that it will need an introduction text explaining so, which basically means bad design. Furthermore, if you long press, the device thinks you want to save the voice image. Again, bad design.

After realizing all of that, it was clear that it had to be changed, and I went for the easier step for both the user and me, always show the fav button on touchable screens.

### COLLAPSABLE VOICE CONTAINERS

For small screens (mobiles), to make it easier for the user to move around the page, they can collapse the 'FAVOURITE VOICES' and 'PRO VOICES' containers. Let's say I have ABC and BCD as favourites, but I want to use the voice CDE. The user could search it, and so when he writes 'C', he will still see the big block of fav voices. He searches for 'CD', and same, he will see it again, bause of 'BCD'.

If we imagine this case on real scale, lets say when he filters there are still 8 favourites. Either he writes the full voice name, or he will have to scroll too much, since he will only see two voices per row.

One way to avoid that is what I thought about, give the user the option to collapse the favourites.

An other option would be to show the matching voices on the same search bar, like a selector, but this feature would be complicated to implement. It could definetly give the user a better experience, but for this is unnecessary and there is not enough time.

### HEADER

The header was the trickest one for me. I firstly made it so it looked like the header on the mockup. Now I had to think of how to do it for mobile.

That was not easy to begin with, because there was so much to pack into it, so I abstracted the important features, which I think is the search bar. I chose to take the other things are secondary.

Having separated important from secondary, now I can make a clean header for mobile. The search bar would be the first thing to see on it, big enough to put some words and still see what you are filtering. The other stuff would be hidden unless the user asks to see it.

To see the other stuff I decided to go for the obvious, a list button that you can find everywhere, which means the user is familiarized with it (hopefully).

When you click it, it shows the other stuff with some nice animations that makes it smoother.

The problem was that to make animations smooth, I needed a max-height. Thankfully since we know the height of the header, it was something that could be implemented.

However, the positioning for this secondary stuff under the menu was not easy to decide. I wanted to base myself on the HTML structure I already had, otherwise I would have to go and change the jQuery, which meant that I could run into small bugs hard to find.

After deciding the structure of the secondary stuff, I ran into an other problem, which demotivated me since this was the last step to do, and I didn't even think this would appear. The problem was showing the selector options. They were being cut of and not display after the header.

Thankfully again, it was simply adding `overflow: visible` when the header is open.

After this I debugged how it would look like even on an iPhone 5 with such a small screen, and still looking great.

Also added a shadow to it and `border-bottom` because having the freedom to decide the mobile design meant I could go for what I think looks better.

If the menu is open, it closes itself whenever the user clicks anywhere on the site except the menu, or when the user scrolls. I implemented this because, if the user is scrolling, then he does not care about the menu, the user is looking for certain voice, and the menu only occupies extra space.

### FONTS

Since there was no reference about what font was being used on the mockup, I went to Google Fonts and picked the one I found most similar. Not exactly the same, but it does the job. If this was a real case, I would ask for the font used to the UI/UX team, and if it was not free, then I would ask for them to send me the font files so I can reference them on the CSS, plus make sure that we have the license for it.


### SELECTORS

Honestly, I never had to deal with this before. I usually just go for Bootstrap, or since I have mostly worked with Angular with PrimeNG, use the ones they give you. I didn't know what a pain dealing with this can be. I found one design online that only used HTML and CSS, thanks to using radio buttons. That's a cool trick, and it was similar to what I needed, so I just changed the CSS so it would look as desired.

It has one problem in my opinion though, which is that the option selected does not show up on the dropdown options, it only shows up on the selected one. I don't really know how to explain it, but I think it's better if the options are always static, so no matter the one you have chosen, if you click on the selector, there will appear the same options in the same order.

Let's say we have A, B, C on the selector, in that order. I select B. Now the selector will appear as B, A, C, since the selected one goes to the top. This could be confusing for the user, but since I have limited time, I prefered to stick to this one rather than implementing something new.

## JAVASCRIPT DETAILS

### RANDOM VOICE

I made the function so it will not choose the same random voice you already have active. Furthermore, if for any given reason there comes a time where you filter by a tag, and that tag only has one voice, and for whatever reason the user wants to go random with one choice, it will apply that choice and not deactivate it, no matter how many times you go random.


### FILTERING

In some cases, like for sorting, I chose the easier to code plus easier to understand way, and simply remove all the voices from the DOM, and print them again. For the filtering however, I decided to not do that, and hide all the voices at first, to then show only the filtered ones.

### `FirefoxFunctionalities`

The code related to the class is needed since Firefox does not implement the pseudo class `::-webkit-search-cancel-button`, and there is no cancel button at all for an input with `type=search`, so I had to implement it manually.

This class was not necessary at all, but since it's a group of functions related only to Firefox, I decided to group them inside a class. With this, I can demonstrate some more knowlege about JS classes and `this` scope.

For instance, on the `searchBarListener` method, I use arrow functions, so `this` has the parent scope, not the funcion one. In this case, the parent is the class, so I can call other funcions from the class.

### `getTags`

At first I made the `getTags` function to return an Array, not a Set. Then I realized that, since I don't want any element repeated, using a Set made the code easier to read, and reduced the size of the function.

This is the older version:

```javascript
function getTags(voices) {
    let tags = [];
    if (voices && voices.length > 0) {
        // This is only to demonstrate knowledge on built-in functions for the array. It would be faster to simply do a forEach.
        // That is beacause with 'filter', 'map', 'some' and 'includes', it ends up doing a similar functionality to 'forEach', and so this code is
        // making unnecesary loops. With a simple 'forEach' I can treat the array inside of it with 'ifs' for instance.
        voices.filter(voice => voice.tags && voice.tags.length > 0).map(voice => voice.tags).forEach(voiceTags => {
            if (tags.length == 0 || !voiceTags.some(voiceTag => tags.includes(voiceTag))) {
                tags = tags.concat(voiceTags); // Could also be done with [...tags, ...voiceTags] for instance.
            } else {
                voiceTags.filter(voiceTag => !tags.includes(voiceTag)).forEach(voiceTag => voiceTag.push(voiceTag));
            }
        });
    }

    return tags;
}
```

## BOOTSTRAP

I've imported Bootstrap just to use the grid system, which if desired, I could have done by hand, but since it's already done and there was no specified rule that said not to use any external CSS Framework, I decided to use it to save some time.

## jQuery

Same as Bootstrap, I've used to save some time, well, a lot of time in this case. I could have done everything with pure JS, but why do so when you always can work with jQuery? There is no real need of having to use pure JS without jQuery, at least as far as I know. It saves a lot of time, and it does not weight much, no reason not to use it.
